### Fix: Combat camera lookup returning exploration camera → wrong spawn positions + black screen
**Files:** `Assets/Scripts/Battle/CombatSystem.cs`, `Assets/Scripts/Dialogue Scripts/DynamicMovementDialogue.cs`

`GetCombatCamera()` was falling back to `Camera.main` when no camera was found in the Combat scene. `Camera.main` is the exploration camera, which is at a different world position depending on where the player is. Viewport-based spawn positions were therefore relative to the exploration camera's current location — correct for the first fight (camera near origin) but wrong for the rat fight (camera has moved). The fallback also caused a null-ref crash when the exploration camera was already deactivated by `PreviousScene`, leaving the screen black.

**Added** `public Camera combatCamera` inspector field to `CombatSystem`. `GetCombatCamera()` checks this first; the scene-based search is a secondary fallback with a clear warning. **Assign the Combat scene's camera to this field in the Unity inspector.**

**Also added** the missing reverse transition call in `InitializeCombatWithData()` — `BattleTransitionManager.Instance.PlayReverseTransition(type)` now fires after spawning, revealing the combat scene from black.

**Also converted** `DynamicCutsceneScript.StartRatEncounter()` from `static void` to `static IEnumerator`. The coroutine now blocks Yarn dialogue until the transition callback fires (`WaitUntil`), preventing the dialogue-complete event from triggering player-control re-enabling during the 0.7 s transition window. Logic from `StartRatFightTrue()` was inlined and the method removed.

### Fix: Combat character visuals spawning in wrong scene (additive loading)
**File:** `Assets/Scripts/Battle/CombatSystem.cs`

`Instantiate()` places objects in the active scene, which stays as the exploration scene during additive loading. Party and enemy walk-sprite prefabs were appearing in the exploration scene hierarchy instead of the Combat scene, causing wrong camera rendering and incorrect positions.

**Added** `SceneManager.MoveGameObjectToScene(obj, gameObject.scene)` after each `Instantiate()` call for both party and enemy visuals.

---

### Feature: Camera-viewport-based spawn positions for combat characters
**File:** `Assets/Scripts/Battle/CombatSystem.cs`

Manually positioned spawn-point transforms inside a UI Canvas were being read as world coordinates scaled by the Canvas Scaler, placing characters in a tiny cluster near the camera origin.

**Added** `GetDefaultPartySpawnPos()` and `GetDefaultEnemySpawnPos()` using `Camera.ViewportToWorldPoint()` to calculate spawn positions at runtime (party left side, enemies right side, all at 20% from screen bottom). Spawn-point inspector fields are kept but bypassed — code always uses viewport positions.

---

### Feature: Combat background sprite per encounter
**Files:** `Assets/Scripts/EncounterS/EncounterFile.cs`, `Assets/Scripts/Battle/CombatSystem.cs`

Replaced `battleBackgroundName` (unused string) with `battleBackground` (Sprite) on `EncounterFile`. `CombatSystem` now has a `backgroundRenderer` (SpriteRenderer) field; `InitializeCombatWithData()` assigns the sprite from the encounter file. Added warnings when either field is unassigned.

**Inspector:** Assign `backgroundRenderer` on the CombatSystem object; assign `battleBackground` sprite on each EncounterFile.

---

### Refactor: Shared encounter setup via `EncounterStarter.BuildEncounterData()`
**Files:** `Assets/Scripts/EncounterS/EncounterStarter.cs`, `Assets/Scripts/Dialogue Scripts/DynamicMovementDialogue.cs`, `Assets/Scripts/Dialogue Scripts/SpecialCutscene.cs`

Both cutscene scripts duplicated the EncounterData setup logic. Extracted into a `public static BuildEncounterData(EncounterFile, SistemaInventario)` method on `EncounterStarter`. All three encounter starters now share identical data-setup logic; only `EncounterStarter.StartEncounter()` sets `encounterStarterObject`.

**Also fixed in SpecialCutsceneScript:** was using `FindFirstObjectByType<SistemaInventario>()` instead of `SistemaInventario.Instance`, and was missing `CalculateRewards()` call.

---

### Fix: Party menu not updating when Simon/Joodie join mid-game
**File:** `Assets/Scripts/Menu Scripts/PartyMenuManager.cs`

`CreatePartyMemberDisplays()` was only called at `Start()` and `OpenMenu()`. When `<<joodieadd>>` or `<<addsimon>>` fired during a cutscene, the menu never refreshed its button/display list.

**Added** `inventory.onPartyUpdated += CreatePartyMemberDisplays` subscription in `Start()`.

---

### Fix: Missing yarn node `sidequest2_complete` causing softlock
**File:** `Assets/Scripts/Dialogue Scripts/prologue_parte2.yarn`

An NPCTalker in the Main Scene referenced a dialogue node `sidequest2_complete` that did not exist in any yarn file. The DialogueRunner would start but never fire `onDialogueComplete`, leaving the player permanently locked.

**Added** stub node `sidequest2_complete` with `<<darken>>` / `<<brighten>>` to unblock; content to be filled in.

---

### Fix: CraftingSimples merge conflict — compass progress now correctly added
**File:** `Assets/Scripts/CraftingSimples.cs`

Merge conflict between `refactor-fixes` and `main` left duplicate/broken setup code in `CraftItem()`. Resolved by keeping the `SistemaInventario.Instance` reference pattern from the refactor branch. `inv.AddProgress("compass")` now always runs after a successful craft.

---

### Fix: FightProgress re-triggering on Rigidbody2D.WakeUp() — Timon soldier softlock
**File:** `Assets/Scripts/Dialogue Scripts/FightProgress.cs`

When `DisablePlayerControl()` / `EnablePlayerControl()` call `Rigidbody2D.Sleep()` / `WakeUp()`, Unity re-evaluates all overlapping triggers. If the player was inside a `FightProgress` zone when a dialogue ended, `OnTriggerEnter2D` would fire again, attempting to start `cantprogressyet` while movement was already re-enabled — causing a softlock when approaching the Timon soldier left→right.

**Added** `if (doingthing) return` guard in `OnTriggerEnter2D` and `OnTriggerExit2D` to reset the guard when the player actually leaves. Works together with the `IsDialogueRunning` guard in `StartDialogue()`.

---

### Feature: Objectives panel toggle in party menu (alpha-based, never deactivated)
**File:** `Assets/Scripts/Menu Scripts/PartyMenuManager.cs`

Added `ToggleObjectives()` (flips `ObjectiveManager`'s `CanvasGroup` alpha 0↔1), `CloseObjectivesPanel()` (sets alpha to 0), and `public GameObject objectivesButton` inspector field. `OpenMenu()` closes the objectives panel before opening party menu. `CloseMenu()` re-shows both `MenuOpener` and `objectivesButton`. The objectives panel is never `SetActive(false)` — visibility is alpha-only to preserve its DontDestroyOnLoad state.

**Wire in inspector:** assign the objectives HUD button to `objectivesButton`; wire the objectives button's OnClick to `PartyMenuManager.ToggleObjectives()`.

### Fix: Cutscene managers destroyed after combat — root cause of multiple bugs
**Files:** `Assets/Scripts/Dialogue Scripts/DynamicMovementDialogue.cs`, `Assets/Scripts/Dialogue Scripts/SpecialCutscene.cs`

Both `DynamicCutsceneScript.StartRatFightTrue()` and `SpecialCutsceneScript.StartEncounterCoroutine()` were setting `encounterData.encounterStarterObject = gameObject`. `PreviousScene.LoadScene()` destroys whatever is in `encounterStarterObject` after combat — intended only for disposable trigger-zone objects (`EncounterStarter`), not manager scripts.

**Removed** `encounterData.encounterStarterObject = gameObject` from both methods.

**Bugs fixed by this change:**
- Janitor (Zelador) not spawning after rat fight — `DynamicCutsceneScript.instance` was set to null on destroy, breaking `<<activate>>` and `<<deactivate>>` Yarn commands; child NPCs were also physically destroyed
- Party members (truejoodie world sprite) disappearing after first battle — child of DynamicCutsceneScript, destroyed with it
- Chest reverting to closed state after combat — potentially a child of the same object
- `"Ignore"` tag not helping — objects were being destroyed entirely, not just deactivated

---

### Fix: Commandant 2 softlock when dialogue already running
**File:** `Assets/Scripts/Dialogue Scripts/ImageScript.cs` (`DialogueManager`)

`NPCTalker` calls `MovimentacaoExploracao.StopForDialogue()` before calling `DialogueManager.StartDialogue()`. If `StartDialogue` returned early because `dialogueRunner.IsDialogueRunning` was already true, the player was left unable to move with no dialogue running.

**Added** `EnablePlayerControl()` to the early-return branch in `StartDialogue()`.
